# CSE 111: Programming Language-II
<p>This course would be an introduction to data structures, formal specification of syntax, elements of language theory and mathematical preliminaries. Other topics that would be covered are formal languages, structured programming concepts, survey of features of existing high level languages. Students would design and write application using an appropriate language.</p>

# Course Objectives

- Contrast between Procedural Programming and Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) and demonstrate the way OOP divides complex problems into smaller parts encouraging modular development.

- Introduce the students to the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming Language like classes, objects, and their properties, and apply them to model real-world applications.

- Enlighten the students about the differences between different types of access modifiers and their importance in encapsulation.

- Explain the rudimentary principles of inheritance and polymorphism and how they can be applied to minimize the complexity of an object-oriented program through code reusability and make it scalable.

- Familiarize the students with the concept of abstract classes, abstract methods, and their application in setting standards for other classes inheriting them.
